# Seaport

The four-part SeaPort Project Series served as the primary means of concept enforcement in CMSC 335, Object Oriented and Current Programming. At its most basic level, the program employs the fundamental principles of object oriented programming and multithreading concurrency to chart the movements of hypothetical ships in a set of sea ports, processing their jobs in real time with the application of included dock workers and moving the vessels about from queue to dock to harbor as their jobs are completed.
